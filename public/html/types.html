                            The Enneagram was originally created in 1915 by
                            philosopher George Gurdjieff, the Enneagram was
                            expanded in the late 1960s to include nine
                            personality types. It is now used as a tool for
                            human development and psychological study.

                        <p>
                            The Enneagram is a personality system, similar to
                            the MBTI, that assists people in better
                            understanding themselves. It provides insights into
                            how people perceive and respond to their
                            surroundings, as well as a framework for personal
                            growth and self-awareness. The system identifies
                            nine main personality types, each with its own style
                            of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Many people
                            believe that learning about the Enneagram helps them
                            have a better grasp of their motivations and
                            relationships.

                        <h3>What are Enneagram Subtypes?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Enneagram also includes instinctive subtypes,
                            which determine how each personality type appears in
                            the world. These subtypes—Self-Preservation (SP),
                            Social (SO), and Sexual (SX)—reflect fundamental
                            survival instincts that influence our attention,
                            behavior, and priorities. While the primary
                            Enneagram type reveals what motivates us, the
                            subtype demonstrates how that motivation is
                            expressed. Understanding these instincts provides
                            greater understanding into our routines,
                            relationships, and emotional patterns.

                        <h3>What are Counter Types (CT)?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Each Enneagram type includes three subtypes, one of
                            which is known as a countertype. This is the subtype
                            that conveys the type's underlying impulses in an
                            unconventional or unusual manner. Countertypes
                            frequently behave differently than what people
                            expect of their type, but sharing the same
                            underlying fear and desire. Recognizing countertypes
                            helps to explain why people with the same Enneagram
                            number might appear completely different from one
                            another.

                        themselves and the world around them. They tend to be
                        organized and principled, but may become overly
                        self-critical when things don’t go as planned.

                        appreciated, often showing care and support through

                        may neglect their own needs in the process of focusing
                        on others.

                        highly motivated and efficient, but may struggle with

                        through emotional depth and authenticity, often feeling
                        a sense of being different or unique. They are
                        introspective and creative, yet may become preoccupied

                        trust, often scanning for potential risks to stay
                        prepared and safe. They are dependable and committed,
                        though they can become anxious or overly cautious when
