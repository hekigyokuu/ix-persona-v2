                            The Enneagram was originally created in 1915 by
                            philosopher George Gurdjieff, the Enneagram was
                            expanded in the late 1960s to include nine
                            personality types. It is now used as a tool for
                            human development and psychological study.

                        <p>
                            The Enneagram is a personality system, similar to
                            the MBTI, that assists people in better
                            understanding themselves. It provides insights into
                            how people perceive and respond to their
                            surroundings, as well as a framework for personal
                            growth and self-awareness. The system identifies
                            nine main personality types, each with its own style
                            of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Many people
                            believe that learning about the Enneagram helps them
                            have a better grasp of their motivations and
                            relationships.

                        <p>
                            The Enneagram also includes instinctive subtypes,
                            which determine how each personality type appears in
                            the world. These subtypes—Self-Preservation (SP),
                            Social (SO), and Sexual (SX)—reflect fundamental
                            survival instincts that influence our attention,
                            behavior, and priorities. While the primary
                            Enneagram type reveals what motivates us, the
                            subtype demonstrates how that motivation is
                            expressed. Understanding these instincts provides
                            greater understanding into our routines,
                            relationships, and emotional patterns.

                            Self-preservation (SP) is one of the Enneagram's
                            three instinctive subtypes. It prioritizes personal
                            safety, comfort, health, and resource management in
                            everyday living. People with this kind are more
                            practical, cautious, and concerned about
                            environmental stability.

                            need for belonging, status, and connection within
                            organizations or communities. It focuses on how
                            people interact with one another in a social
                            setting, which is frequently expressed as a desire

                            with people. It emphasizes emotional chemistry,
                            passion, and the desire to merge with someone on a

                        <p>
                            Each Enneagram type includes three subtypes, one of
                            which is known as a countertype. This is the subtype
                            that conveys the type's underlying impulses in an
                            unconventional or unusual manner. Countertypes
                            frequently behave differently than what people
                            expect of their type, but sharing the same
                            underlying fear and desire. Recognizing countertypes
                            helps to explain why people with the same Enneagram
                            number might appear completely different from one
                            another.
